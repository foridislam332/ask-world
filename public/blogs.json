        "details": "OKAY. How much do we love these meatballs? And this whole sandwich? It’s an 11/10 for me. THEY ARE SO GOOD. The meatballs are jam-packed with flavor, golden brown on the outside, and perfectly tender. What a dream. This whole thing comes together shockingly easy, especially if you use a little blitzer like this guy to mince all the meatball mix-ins! The meatballs will beg to be eaten straight out of the pan as an “appetizer” before you even get to the sandwich",

The uncrewed Orion spacecraft, currently on its way home from the Moon, must still survive a harrowing reentry through Earth’s atmosphere if it’s to perform a successful splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. NASA is hoping that a new technique, known as a skip reentry, will assist the capsule during the final leg of its long and historic journey.",
